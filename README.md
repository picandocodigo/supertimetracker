# Super Simple Time Tracker

JavaScript time tracker - https://supertimetracker.com

## Instructions:

You don't need to create an account, group or client. You don't need to share your e-mail address, name or phone number with the site. Just track your time.

Your information is not being shared with third-parties (other than Analytics data) and you can just track time peacefully.

Click on the timer to start and stop the clock. Write the current task's description and save it whenever you're done. You can then export your data to JSON or CSV or just Copy/Paste it from the table below.
